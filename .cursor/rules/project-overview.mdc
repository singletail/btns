# Project Rules

- This project is for esp32s3 running a custom ESP-IDF v5.4.1 program to do multiple things depending upon the specific build, and which modules are enabled. 

### Some uses are:

- ws2812b-style led strip control
- Sensors (presence/bio/etc)
- Home Assistant data delivery and incoming control commands
- Wearables, including LED strips
- Playing sound effects based on events

### Some things I want to add are:

- Sound playback from an SD memory card
- Use as a Star Trek-like bridge control panel.
- More sensors
- Deployment on a mesh network

## Notes

- This is currently for personal, prototype use, so it does not necessarily need to conform to commercial-grade standards, but I do strive for high-quality and safety.

- For now, I am testing on a breadboard, then hand-soldering components on perfboard. Perhaps some day I will design a real PCB, but not this week.

- I currently have the wearable prototype board down to a hand-soldered 1" x 1" PCB, including the esp32s3, a 74HCT24, and a "normal" setup for caps on the 5V battery input, proper grounding with resistors, resistors as filters for the LED strips. When discussing wearables specifically, keep pcb space in mind.
